# Context

In Europe some countries are going to run out of mechanical ventilators for patients in intensive care units.
It is already the case in Italy, and France probably follow shortly.
It is also likely that similar crisis will arise in African countries.

# Propositions

## Recovid-MD - close to a medical device grade ventilator
This is our current target.

## Recovid-simple

## Recovid-DIY

It is not clear if this type of device is of any use in a Hospital.
No sensors, so no clinically usable data.


## Scrap-made presure valves (APL, PEEP)

![2 level fixed pressure regulator](/images/cjlloljjpboomneh.png)
material: aquarium tube 4mm internal / 6mm external
Section not enough enough I would have to double the diameter
2 or 4 non-return valve:

pipe 4/6mm :

possibility of using diffusers in a volume of water to filter the exhaled air:

ISSUE:
* the rectangular volumes prevent the water used for pressure control from leaving the system I still don't know how to make them.
* the system is not adjustable in pressure ... except to put several PEP control system in parallel with small valves: not terrible
